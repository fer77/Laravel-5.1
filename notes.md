Laravel allows to resolve your service directly from your _blade_ view.
```Route::get('/', function(App\Stats $stats) {
	return view('welcome', compact('stats'));
});```

```Route::get('other', function(App\Stats $stats) {
	return view('other', compact('stats'));
});```
It gets too verbose to have to keep passing `App\Stats $stats` to every view that needs this service class.

One solution is to create a _view composer_:
```View::composer('stats', function($view) {
	$view->with('stats', app('App\Stats'));
});```
```Route::get('/', function() {
	return view('welcome');
});```

```Route::get('other', function() {
	return view('other');
});```

The new solution is to inject your _view composer_ directly into our view:

* .blade.php:

_Add this to your blade file_

`@inject('stats', 'App\Stats')`

* routes.php:

_remove our view composer_

```Route::get('/', function() {
	return view('welcome');
});```

```Route::get('other', function() {
	return view('other');
});```

**Elixir** now compiles and concatenates seperate .css .js files.

```elixir(function(mix) {
	mix.less(['app.less', 'other.less']);
});```

now makes one _app.css_ file.

**Elixir** also provides _ECMS6_ support.

```elixir(function(mix) {
	mix.scripts(['one.js', 'two.js']);
});```

now makes one _all.js_ file.  It can also be placed somewhere else:

```elixir(function(mix) {
	mix.scripts(['one.js', 'two.js'
	], 'public/foo/bar.js');
});```

Will save it to `public/foo/bar.js`.  **Elixir** will also run your _ECMS6_ through the _Babel_ compiler.

```elixir(function(mix) {
	mix.babel(['one.js', 'two.js'
	]);
});```

Just switch _scripts_ with _babel_.
