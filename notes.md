Laravel resolves your services directly from your _blade_ view.
```php
Route::get('/', function(App\Stats $stats) {
	return view('welcome', compact('stats'));
});
```

```php
Route::get('other', function(App\Stats $stats) {
	return view('other', compact('stats'));
});
```
This, however, gets too verbose. Having to keep passing `App\Stats $stats` to every view that needs this _service class_.

One solution is to create a _view composer_:
```php
View::composer('stats', function($view) {
	$view->with('stats', app('App\Stats'));
});
```
```php
Route::get('/', function() {
	return view('welcome');
});
```

```php
Route::get('other', function() {
	return view('other');
});
```

The new solution is to inject your _view composer_ directly into our view:


* .blade.php:

_Add this to your blade file_

`@inject('stats', 'App\Stats')`


* routes.php:

_remove our view composer and_

```php
Route::get('/', function() {
	return view('welcome');
});
```

```php
Route::get('other', function() {
	return view('other');
});
```

**Elixir** now compiles and concatenates seperate .css/.js files.

```javascript
elixir(function(mix) {
	mix.less(['app.less', 'other.less']);
});
```

now makes one _app.css_ file.

**Elixir** also provides _ECMS6_ support.

```javascript
elixir(function(mix) {
	mix.scripts(['one.js', 'two.js']);
});
```

now makes one _all.js_ file.  It can also be placed somewhere else:

```javascript
elixir(function(mix) {
	mix.scripts(['one.js', 'two.js'
	], 'public/foo/bar.js');
});
```

Will save it to `public/foo/bar.js`.  **Elixir** will also run your _ECMS6_ through the _Babel_ compiler.

```javascript
elixir(function(mix) {
	mix.babel(['one.js', 'two.js'
	]);
});
```

Just switch _scripts_ with _babel_.

Most of the integrated API has now been integrated into Laravel 5.1.
Remember tha in `composer.json` there are third party libraries we have acces to:


1. _faker_: generates dummy data.

2. _mockery_: for mocking classes. 

```json
"require-dev": {
        "fzaninotto/faker": "~1.4",
        "mockery/mockery": "0.9.*",
        "phpunit/phpunit": "~5.7"
    },
```

This will run _phpunit_ when a test or file within the app directory is changed.

`/Feature/ExampleTest.php` For larger features.
`Unit/ExampleTest.php` lower level features.

run `vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`

Each of these represent functionality that we can import into our test.
```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithoutMiddleware;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseMigrations;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\DatabaseTransactions;
```
